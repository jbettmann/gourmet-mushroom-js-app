# PokeDex App

This is a web app that I created for the Full Stack Development Course at CareerFoundry.

Description: This PokeDex loads data from an external API. \([Pok√©API](https://pokeapi.co)\). While data is being retrieved, a loading spinner is displayed. Once loaded, the loading spinner is hidden and the user is able to select a Pokemon of their choosing to view the Pokemon's details. A modal is then displayed with the Pokemon's name, height and type. The user also has the option of searching for a specific Pokemon via the search bar at the top right corner of the PokeDex.
Built with:

HTML
CSS
JavaScript
jQuery
Bootstrap
